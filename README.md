# ObserverbasedControlTS

This repository is used to have a version control on my current research work. Usually I forget to do same safety copies so this way I can have back-ups. Also it is nice to have a clean version of the implementation part so that I can use it later on.

Here I want to store the Matlab Simulink implementation part and the Overleaf Latex files.
